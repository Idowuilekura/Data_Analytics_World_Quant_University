# # Object-oriented exercises
# ## Introduction
# The objective of these exercises is to develop your familiarity with Python's `class` syntax and object-oriented
# programming. By deepening our understanding of Python objects, we will be better prepared to work with complex data
# structures and machine learning models. We will develop a `Point` class capable of handling some simple linear
# algebra operations in 2D.
